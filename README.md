# Q-Core: Quantum-Enhanced AI Assistant

**Q-Core** is a next-generation AI assistant that runs 100% locally on Linux. It combines the reasoning of Large Language Models (Phi-3) with simulated Quantum Natural Language Processing (PennyLane) for unique, non-deterministic interactions.

## 🚀 Features
- **Hybrid Architecture:** Uses a Classical LLM (Phi-3) + Quantum Circuit (PennyLane) for decision making.
- **Privacy First:** Runs locally via Ollama. No data leaves your machine.
- **Voice Activated:** Full "Jarvis-like" voice control.
- **Agentic Actions:** Can control web browsers, terminals, and system processes.
- **Persistent Memory:** Remembers user details across sessions.
